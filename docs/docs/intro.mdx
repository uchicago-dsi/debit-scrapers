# Introduction

To shed light on the opaque world of international development finance, the Development Bank Investment Tracker (DeBIT) collects, standardizes, augments, and aggregates data on projects funded by high-profile financial institutions with independent acountability mechanisms (IAMs). Currently, there are 17 such institutions:

- African Development Bank (AfDB)
- Asian Development Bank (ADB)
- Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)
- Belgian Investment Company for Developing Countries (BIO)
- Deutsche Investitions - und Entwicklungsgesellschaft (DEG)
- European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)
- European Investment Bank (EIB)
- Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)
- International Finance Corporation (IFC)
- Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW)
- Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)
- Nederlandse Financierings-Maatschappij voor Ontwikkelingslanden (FMO)
- Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM)
- U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC)
- Proparco
- United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
- World Bank (WB)

The DeBIT data pipeline is written in Python and uses Django. Each pipeline stage exists as a separate Django app that can be deployed and maintained independently.
